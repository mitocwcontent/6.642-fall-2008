description: Peak pattern with a magnetic field of about 330 Gauss perpendicular to
  an oil-based ferrofluid layer. The peaks initiate in an hexagonal array when the
  magnetic surface force exceeds the stabilizing effects of fluid weight and surface
  tension. (Image courtesy of Prof. Markus Zahn.)
